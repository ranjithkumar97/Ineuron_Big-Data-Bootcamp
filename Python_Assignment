## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Ans===> Python is an interpreted language. This means that every time a program is run, 
	its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable byte code.
	Because they are not written in machine-readable language,
	Python programs need to be processed before machines can run them.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Ans===> It doesn't know about the type of variable until the code is run.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Ans===> 
Pros:
		---> It is simple and easy to use 
		---> It is Object- Oriented and has lots of Libraries
		---> It has built in Data structures and increases speed and productivity
		
Cons:
		---> Speed limitations and Problems with threading
		---> Memory consumption
		

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Ans===> Since Python is the go-to programming language for domains such as artificial intelligence, 
	machine learning and deep learning, it's no surprise that it's also a fundamental tool for any data scientist.


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Ans===> Variables are used to store value in the memory location.

	Any variable name sholud be start with alphabets and the name given to a speicfic memory loaction.

	To declare the variable, we are using assignment operators to store the specific value

	i.e (int_var=10)---> int_var is a variable name, = is an assinment operator and 10 is the value

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

Ans===> By using the function called as input () as built in function 


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Ans===> The input() function by default returns the value as string data type

Q8. What is type casting?

Ans===> It is the method to convert the variable data type into a certian data type in order to opertion required to be performed by end user.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Ans===> A function can take multiple inputs however one simple case is taking two inputs, like varibale as Name and Age

Q10. What are keywords?

Ans===> Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

Ans===> Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler.

	We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. 

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Ans===> Python indentation refers to adding white space before a statement to a particular block of code.
	In most programming languages, indentation is used to properly structure the code

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

Ans===> By using Print() function, i.e print("Hello ineuron") ~ Output: Hello ineuron

Q14. What are operators in Python?

Ans===> Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values
	* Arithmetic operators
	* Assignment operators
	* Comparison operators
	* Logical operators
	
Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

Ans===>	The single forward slash / operator is known as float division, which returns a floating point value.
	The double forward slash // operator returns a floored value, specifically either a floored integer or floating point value.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans===> var_first ="iNeuron"
	print(var_first*3) ~ Output: iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
		
Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

Ans===> For finding odd or even using modulo operator ( num%2==0)
	
	int_num=input("Enter the number")
	casted_num=int(int_num)

	if casted_num%2==0:
    		print("Here is the even number",int_num)
	else:
    		print("Here is the odd number",int_num)

	print("Thank you!")


Q18. What are boolean operator?

Ans====> Boolean is a data type that is used to store two values True and False
	In python, we can evaluate any expression and can get one of two answers
	While comparing two values the expression is evaluated to either true or false.

Q19. What will the output of the following?

1 or 0 ---> True

0 and 0 ---->True

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

Ans===> A conditional statement in python, also called a condition constructs, is a statement that accommodates a condition inside itself. 
	This condition is constructed using the bitwise, boolean, and comparison operators in Python. if, elif and else

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

	elif is also known as Nested if
	else is used for the

	if (result>=18):
    		print("I can vote")
	else:
    		print("I can't vote")

for sub in test_list:
    for ele in str(sub):
         
        # adding in particular summation according to value
        if int(ele) % 2 == 0:
